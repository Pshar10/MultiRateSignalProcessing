# Multi-Rate Signal Processing

This repository demonstrates basic applied concepts of Multi-Rate Signal Processing. The repository includes files implementing decimation, interpolation, and filter design for multi-rate systems, with various matrices and transformations used in digital signal processing.

## Basic Concepts in Multi-Rate Signal Processing

- **Decimation (Downsampling)**: Reducing the sampling rate of a signal by retaining every M-th sample, useful for saving storage and reducing computational load.
- **Interpolation (Upsampling)**: Increasing the sampling rate by inserting new samples between existing ones. Common in digital-to-analog conversion.
- **Polyphase Decomposition**: Efficient method for implementing filters in multi-rate systems.
- **Filter Banks**: Separates a signal into multiple components with different frequency bands, widely used in audio and image processing.
- **Downsampling and Upsampling Filters**: Low-pass filters applied to maintain signal integrity during decimation and interpolation.

## Repository Structure

### Files
